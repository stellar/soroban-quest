# Helpful Python Scripts

If you're going to use any of these, make sure you install the `9.0.0-beta0`
version of the Python `stellar_sdk` first, as described below. Also please note
these scripts are **NOT REQUIRED** for this Quest, but we found them to be
_incredibly_ helpful while developing it. So, we wanted to pass them along for
your benefit and future use, learnings, and experiments.

Enjoy!

```bash
pip install --upgrade stellar-sdk
```

Massive props to [Jun Luo (@overcat)](https://github.com/overcat) for his
incredible work on the Python SDK. These Python scripts are copy/pasted from the
Python SDK (nearly) verbatim. Check them out here:
